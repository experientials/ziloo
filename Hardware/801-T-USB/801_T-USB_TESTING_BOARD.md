# 801 T-USB testing board

This testing board hosts the 801 T-USB daughter board.

The 801 is a bridge board that connects daughter boards. 801 T-USB is one such daughter board.

The T-USB daughterboard has three functions
- Supply the system with power
- Provide data signals in the system over two USB-C connectors
- Manage autonomous system functions and waking state

The T-USB board exposes two vertical USB-C sockets and connects to the carrier board through two 50 pin B2B connectors.
These are routed ultimately through two USB-C connectors on the testing board.

The testing board can also be used to test the bridge board. For this purpose there are two plugs on the underside that connect
directly to the sockets on the upperside apart from the VSOM pins.

## LEDs

LEDs will test specific situations and test cases

- Battery STAT (BAT_STAT - BAT_LDO), see battery charger spec
- Battery power good (PWR_CHARGE above 4.3V), see battery charger spec
- VSOM power on any of the regular VSOM pins (upper 36..48)
- VSOM voltage on regular VSOM pins are >4.5V
- VCC_RTC provides power (rated at ~2V)
- Power on Reset POR_B_3P3
- System powered on, PMIC_ON_REQ raised high
- System powering down, PMIC_STBY_REQ raised high
- VSOM_LOCK powered (upper)
- Each of the VSOM corners 1, 1, 26, 26 (upper) supplies power

POR_B_3P3, PMIC_ON_REQ and PMIC_STBY_REQ would potentially only be raised high for a very short interval.
I suppose a capacitor can be added to ensure that the LED is powered long enough for it to be visible.


# Connecting the Board


### Signals passed to USB-C connectors

The T-USB board connects to two separate USB 2.0+3.0 signal sources via the 50 pin connectors. In order to test the T-USB board the testing board has supply the equivalent signals it should be possible to connect the two sets of signals via two USB-C connectors. Since USB-C is polarity ambivalent a HD3SS3220 chip is added between each of the USB-C connectors and the 50 pin connectors.

An example of connecting USB 2+3 signals to USB-C via a HD3SS3220 can be seen here.

![USB-C wiring](../refs/usb-c-test-data.png)

The USB 2/3 data lines are connected to the 50 pin connectors on both the upperside and underside of the PCB.

Here are the 50 pin connector pins routed to USB-C connectors via the HD3SS3220:

## Underside 50 pin plugs VSOM connection header

This header breaks out the power pins from the underside 50 pin connectors. 
It allows connecting or disconnecting power pins selectively to the same pin on the upperside connector.
These pins on the 50 pin connectors are not connected to the upperside directly.
This connector sits next to the Upperside VSOM connection header to allow easy 1-to-1 connection.
C1 refers to Connector 1 high-speed data.

## Upperside 50 pin sockets VSOM connection

This header breaks out the power pins from the upperside 50 pin connectors. 
It allows connecting or disconnecting power pins selectively to the same pin on the underside connector.
These pins on the 50 pin connectors are not connected to the underside directly.
The breakout enables testing partial insertion of the sockets. 
If pins are not bridged between the upperside and underside connectors, the power is not passed between the under- and uppperside.
C1 refers to Connector 1 high-speed data.
