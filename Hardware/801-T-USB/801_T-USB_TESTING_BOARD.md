# 801 T-USB testing board

This testing board hosts the 801 T-USB daughter board.

The 801 is a bridge board that connects daughter boards. 801 T-USB is one such daughter board.

The T-USB daughterboard has two functions
- Supply the system with power
- Provide data signals in the system over two USB-C connectors

The T-USB board exposes two vertical USB-C sockets and connects to the carrier board through two 50 pin B2B connectors.
These are routed ultimately through two USB-C connectors on testing board

# Testing with the board

## Testing cases 

* Routing UART over breakout connectors
* VSOM load test
* Interrupt triggering
* Requesting system standby
* Detecting system standby
* Triggering system reset
* Detecting system reset
* Powering dev board from T-USB power output
* Simulating CONN_EN signal
* High voltage USB-C (20V / 12V / 9V) power supplies never produces more than 5V SYS_PWR when connected.
* If one USB port receives power (5V) the other port can deliver power (5V).
* VSOM is 3.45V to 4.4V regardless of charger
* If a Apple Dedicated Charger 5V(1A BC1.2) is connected the board can draw 1A
* If a CDP(5V, 1A) compatible charger is connected the board can draw 1A
* If a CDP(5V, 3A) compatible charger is connected the board can draw 3A
* If power is connected to USB the battery can charge
* If no power is connected the system is battery powered
* USB 3.0 data signal can be passed through from T-USB OTG to testing board OTG, and reverse min. 250MB/sec
* USB 3.0 data signal can be passed through from T-USB Host to testing board Host, and reverse min. 250MB/sec
* USB 2.0 data signal can be passed through from T-USB OTG to testing board OTG, and reverse min. 35MB/sec
* USB 2.0 data signal can be passed through from T-USB Host to testing board Host, and reverse min. 35MB/sec
* Power and Data works through T-USB ports with 300 cm cable length.
* USB signal jitter within accepted range (see USB 3.0 Electrical Compliance Methodology)
