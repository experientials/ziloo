# 801 T-USB testing board

This testing board hosts the 801 T-USB daughter board.

The 801 is a bridge board that connects daughter boards. 801 T-USB is one such daughter board.

The T-USB daughterboard has three functions
- Supply the system with power
- Provide data signals in the system over two USB-C connectors
- Manage autonomous system functions and waking state

The T-USB board exposes two vertical USB-C sockets and connects to the carrier board through two 50 pin B2B connectors.
These are routed ultimately through two USB-C connectors on the testing board.

The testing board can also be used to test the bridge board. For this purpose there are two plugs on the underside that connect
directly to the sockets on the upperside apart from the VSOM pins.
