# 801 T-USB daughterboard Upwork task

The T-USB daughterboard has two functions
- Supply the system with power
- Support smart future waking/suspend logic
- Provide data signals in the system over two USB-C connectors

The T-USB board exposes two vertical USB-C sockets and connects to the carrier board through two 50 pin B2B connectors.
For future feature development the board also has two FPC breakout connectors.

In addition to this board a matching **testing/breakout board must be designed**.

We already have a development board designed so this tasks breaks out part of an existing design (909) on a dedicated baord (801 T-USB).

The provided documentation includes

- Detailed functionality, wiring, connections for T-USB board
- Detailed functionality, wiring, connections for TESTING board
- Functionality Testing cases
- Reference diagram for Compulab development board
- Reference diagram for 909 development board
- Component datasheets

## Milestones:

The project is broken down in milestones to ensure a correct design.

### Testing board design $300

Do a design for the testing board and layout with Eagle or Altium

- Precise placement of USB-C socket holes
- Preciese placement of upper and under 50 pin connectors
- Breakout connectors can be arranged differently
- USB breakout connectors should be as suggested
- The breakout part of the board can be enlarged if needed

Once the design is done we will order a few boards for me and yourself for testing.


### Initial board designs  $800

Do an initial board diagram and layout with Eagle or Altium.

- Confirmation of BoM
- PD Controller working as a power sink(not source)
- Power Regulators
- Power LED, Power and Reset buttons
- 45 pin breakout connectors
- USB-C sockets
- Battery charger
- Design both boards

Deliverables:

- Diagrams(.sch) + Board layout design files
- Gerber files
- Review the choice of component and suggest alternative if needed.
- Confirmation of BoM
- Get production quotes with JLCPCB, PCBWAY etc. for 10pc, 100pcs, 1000pcs (assembled and basic)


### Ordering test batch of boards $0

We then do a test batch of 801 T-USB boards


### Verification of design and fixes - $400

Receive the test boards and test the acceptance tests. Make sure all tests pass.
Correct any issues after reviewing with me.

Deliverables:

- Diagrams(.sch) + Board layout design files
- Gerber files
- Testing report with measurements
