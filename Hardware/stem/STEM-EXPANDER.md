# Stembus Expander

The Stembus Expander is a standard module similar to an I/O Expander. It accesses local control pins and state to provide remote control capability over the 
Stem I2C bus. It rules over a distinct domain and will raise Stem INT events(1-Wire) when the domain is affected.

It can,

- Reset components
- Power on/off/suspend components
- Change component state and mode selection
- Raise relevant event flags

Ziloo has three expanders with distinct domains;

- T-USB Expander monitors and controls Module runtime, Battery charging, USB Power Delivery, and USB Alt. Mode.
- Faceboard Expander monitors IMU, m.2 modules
- The Smart Ambient Night Eye also monitors and controls sensors to determine change in ambient state. Sound, light and vision a monitored.

Available actions,

- Set T-USB 2.0 Alt. modes state (byte)
- Set T-USB 3.0 Alt. modes state (byte)

The [G2553](./datasheets/msp430g2553.pdf) routes debugging and programming over RST/TEST (even if not shown in diagram).



### Programming

The MSP430 is programmed using the Bootloader. See bootloader section in the specific datasheet for pins.

Bootloader mode is triggered by a specific timing signal over the RST/DTR and TEST/RTS pins. 
Once in bootloader mode the UART_EX_TXD and UART_EX_RXD are used to upload the new firmware. 
These pins are exposed on the 50 pin connector and available to the i.MX SoM and Picoprobe socket. 
The SoM will use this to update firmware without opening the case. One the Expander has been flash a unique password is set on future writing. 
Future updates must use this password to be applied.

One way to program the MSP430 is via the Picoprobe running [pico-uart-brige](https://github.com/Noltari/pico-uart-bridge/tree/uart-hw-flow).
This make it available as a Comm port over USB to a Linux host on Raspberry Pi or other CI Runner.
See example code for implementation at [MSP430TM Bootloader With SitaraTM Embedded Linux Host](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slaa760/slaa760.pdf?ts=1659387003455&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.ti.com%252Ftool%252FMSPBSL).

### I2C access

The primary I2C bus, where the Expander exposes its connected gpio output and input, is the Stem I2C.
The Stem I2C is mastered by one of the MCUs connected such as RT core in SoM or the RP2040 in the Smart Camera Module.
The expander can also provide its service on the SYS I2C.


#### Interrupt events

It is important to consider the overall system interrupt events

- T-USB PD state change -> T-USB module raises STEM INT with a 1 wire origin signal.
- T-USB Charging state change -> T-USB module raises STEM INT with a 1 wire origin signal.
- Faceboard sensor event -> Faceboard module raises STEM INT with a 1 wire origin signal and MOTION_INT
- Faceboard m.2 event -> Faceboard module raises STEM INT with a 1 wire origin signal

After an MCU has raised a Stem INT it may not do so for again for 10ms. This allows other MCUs to raise their events.

![LQFP64 pins](./datasheets/MSP430FR2032-LQFP.png)

TSSOP56: 14mm x 6.1mm x 1.2mm

Programming pins

| Expander           | VQFN32| LQFP | G56 | Connected to    |
|--------------------|-------|------|-----|-----------------|
| RST / NMI / T_SBWTDIO | 23 | 10   | 16  | Reset. Nunmaskable interrupte input. T_SWBTDIO on 50 pins, DTR on Comms   |
| TEST / SBWTCK      | 24    | 11   | 17  | T_SWBTCK on 50 pins, RTS on Comms. Sel. test mode for JTAG pins on Port 1. Device protection fuse cnnctd to TEST |
| UART_T_TXD         |  1    | 24   | 28  | Firmware transmit (see Bootloader section in datasheet)     |
| UART_T_RXD         |  5    | 23   | 27  | Firmware receive (see Bootloader section in datasheet)     |

The programming UART pins are not consistent across models. This matches FR2032(G56), FR413x(LQFP), G2433/G2553(VQFN32 P1.1 and P1.5).


### MSP430 pin allocations

The intended FR2032 chip uses a TSSOP-56 (G56) package.

These pins are used in a special role

:[Combined T-USB bus I/O Expander](../pinouts/T-USB_BUS_EXPANDER.md)

Pins used as GPIO

:[Combined T-USB control I/O Expander](../pinouts/T-USB_GPIO_EXPANDER.md)


## Alt. Design using Shift registers (output only)

If a 48+ IO MSP430 chip is not available a setup is used with 24 IO.
In this setup shift registers are used.

Three shift registers are chained off the 7 shift pins.
Individual pins triggers the update of output for 8 bytes.
A fourth output trigger pin is reserved for a future bank.
This lessens the requirement to remember existing state.
For the 64 pin package shift registers are not used.

| Function     | VQFN32 | LQFP | G56 | Connected to    |
|--------------|--------|------|-----|-----------------|
| SH1_DS       | 6      | 55   | 55  | P3.1. 74HC595 DS    |
| SH1_SHCP     | 12     | 54   | 54  | P3.2. 74HC595 SHCP  |
| SH1_MR       | 13     | 53   | 53  | P3.3. 74HC595 MR |
| SH1_STCP     | 14     | 52   | 52  | P3.4. 74HC595 STCP |
| SH2_STCP     | 18     |      |     | P3.5. 74HC595 STCP |
| SH3_STCP     | 19     |      |     | P3.6. 74HC595 STCP |
| SH4_STCP     | 20     |      |     | P3.7. 74HC595 STCP |


The output pins on the shift registers are grouped as,

- SH1 Alt mode bits,
- SH2 SoM Runtime control shift reg
- SH3 PD And Charging control shift reg
- SH4 unallocated shift register.

## Faceboard expander pin allocations

The faceboard expander runs on 1.8V signal level. It is in the 1V8 domain with camera modules and m.2 connectors.

Pins used as GPIO

:[Combined Faceboard control I/O Expander](../pinouts/FACE_GPIO_EXPANDER.md)


The system expander #0 is used by the SoM via SYS I2C.
The system expander input triggers interrupt via SYS_EX_nINT (GPIO4_IO19).
This expander deals with activity relevant during waking state.

This first expander, which is also on the dev. board maps,

| Expander  | Connected to    |
