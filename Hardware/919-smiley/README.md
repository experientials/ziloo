# 919 Smiley

Face board used to face the user and bridge daughterboards.

It contains a Bosch Sensortech 32 bit RISC processor that monitors 3D movement using a gyroscope and accelerometer.
It communicates with the Host MCU via the Stem I2C bus (I2C3 for the MCU daughterboard). 
It exposes system control signals via the SYS I2C GPIO Expander 0.
Sensors on camera modules are available via Master 2 & 3.

A second chip is optional BMM150 to provide a magnetometer.


Alternate battery connection option for running detached.

## Camera connectors

Two sets of camera connectors are on the board for left and right sides respectively.
The 22 pin connector allows a Development board to be connected with a Raspberry Pi Zero compatible flex cable.
The 34 pin connector allows attachment of a 201 Camera Module made for it.
Signals will be transferred directly between the two connectors using voltage shifters

## LED layout

LEDs are laid out as eyebrows and a mouth. They are connected to the multiplexer as 7 sets of 9 LEDs (7x9 mode).
1) Brow x 2
1) Eye sides x 2 (reverse of brow signal)
3) Smile x 2
5) Sad x 2 (reverse of smile signal)
7) Cheeks, split 4 left 4 right.

Numbering of individual LEDs are from top-left to right.
The eyebrow sets are doubled up with the eye side using reverse polarity. The eye sides get signals from VIAs close to the eye hole.

The smile if formed by a left side and a right. LED numbering starts in the middle.
A sad smile uses the same multiplexer banks but with reverse polarity.

LEDs are marked with identifiers on the connector side, but not on the front side.

### LED mounting

Most LEDs are mounted by embedding them into the board. The PCB being 1mm thick a recess is made to fit the LED of 0.4mm. In the center a 0.4mm hole is drilled to let through light.


## MotionEngine I2C Sensor

The BOSCH sensor includes an embedded processor communicating via I2C. It boots from a 1MB flash chip. It runs and communicates on is 1.8V.

https://www.mouser.ch/ProductDetail/Bosch-Sensortec/BHI260AP?qs=T94vaHKWudTEPTnGI%252BTy9w%3D%3D

BHI260AB I2C modes support 3.4 Mbit/s. Put on SYS or 3 ? HSCX + HSDX. i.MX 8 can only do 400KHz.

Power comes from any of the SOM lines via the two 50 pins connectors. Isolate them and down regulate to 3.3V.

Host I2C is I2C3 on the CPU side.
Master I2C 2 is I2C6 on the CPU side, Right CAM CSI2 SCCB & Ambient Light.
Master I2C 3 is I2C5 on the CPU side, Left CAM CSI1 SCCB & Laser Scan.
Master is is free for SPI communication.
