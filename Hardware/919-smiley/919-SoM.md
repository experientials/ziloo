For further details see [Product Page](https://www.compulab.com/products/computer-on-modules/ucm-imx8m-plus-nxp-i-mx-8m-plus-som-system-on-module-computer/).

The CSI1 & CSI2 are wired from the 100pin connectors to relevant CSI connectors.
The CSI1 lanes are connected to Left CSI.
The CSI2 lanes are connected to Right CSI.
The USB1 and USB2 data will be connected to multiplexers
The 45 pins Debug connector will break out many additional signal lines

- 2 * Hirose 100 pin connectors are used to connect the SoM daughter board
