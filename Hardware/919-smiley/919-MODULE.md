# 919 Smiley

Face board used to face the user and bridge daughterboards. It is used only for internal testing and development.
For production of faceboards a designation of 701 is used.

It contains a MEMSIC mCube MC6470 3D movement sensor with a gyroscope and accelerometer, which is managed by the Stem MCU on the T-USB board.
It communicates with the Stem MCU via the Stem I2C bus, and the SoM i.MX 8 via the SYS I2C. 
It exposes system control signals via the SYS I2C GPIO Expander 0.

Connectors are present to support attachment of two camera modules.

A LED matrix driver controls 120 LEDs producing expressions on the front of the board.
The LEDs are 1mm long and embedded in the board in order to create a diffused light.

![919 back side](./919-smiley-back-face-dev-1.png)

The board allows for experimental mounting of a an i.MX 8 Plus SoM.
The production version 701 will have the SoM daughtercard and other components without mounting debug/development connectors.

## Camera connectors

Two sets of camera connectors are on the board for left and right sides respectively.
The 22 pin connector allows a Development board to be connected with a Raspberry Pi Zero compatible flex cable.
The 34 pin connector allows attachment of a 201 Camera Module made for it.
Signals will be transferred directly between the two connectors using voltage shifters

The dual camera connectors are also connected to the SoM.
i.MX8 CSI1 is used for left module, CSI2 is used for right module.

The two 34 pin CSI connectors are wired to run in sync via the STROBE pin.

The power supplied to the 34 pins connector can be driven by the 22 pin connector or the T-USB Power Module.
VSOM from power module is down-regulated to 3V3, 2V8 and 1V8 from 3.7V - 5V. This downregulation can be shared between Left and Right cameras.

The 1.8V driving the Sensor I/O of the 201 modules will also be supplied via the Self powered direct battery input.


## Board Power

The board can be powered by 3V+ via a directly attached battery, or a pin on back GPIO header, which is down regulated. 
The self power input will power the Motion Engine and camera sensors with 1.8V. 
This can be used to run the board in an always on mode that records movement while disconnected from the power module.
The SELF_PWR input will be used to supply VCC_RTC pins.

When the Power module is connected it supplies VSOM, which powers the MotionEngine, LED Matrix driver and camera modules.
VSOM is down regulated from around 4V to 1V8, 2V8 and 3V3. When connected, no power is drawn from the battery on the bridge board.

Voltage pins are

* Self powered 2V+ input
* Always on 1V8 output VCC_RTC
* Powered 1V8 output
* Powered 2V8 output
* Powered 3V3 output
* Powered 5V output
* VSOM output

[?] Is it possible to support both 5V in and out on the GPIO pins? 5V input would be downregulated to 4V if power module isn't connected.
5V output would be upregulated VSOM.


SELF_PWR
Optional battery power input for driving the boards always on components while a power module isn't connected.
Power might be supplied by a CR2032 or LIR1220 battery.
This can be supplied by connecting to the pin on the backplane GPIO header or the RTC battery slot.

VSOM
Supplied by power module over multiple pins. When all pins are connected it is passed on to full-on mode components as VCC_FULL.

VCC_RTC
This powers always-on components on attached modules. It is sourced from any of the power module VCC_RTC or VSOM pins and downregulated.
If the power module isn't connected or doesn't provide any power the fallback is SELF_PWR.

Power module provides either,
- No power
- VCC_RTC only
- Some VSOM pins
- Full VSOM (all pins) 

The power provided will force the system state to be
- Off
- Detached
- Suspended (fully powered)
- Running (fully powered)

The battery connector may be change to use LIR1220(3.6V) or ML1220(3V), which are rechargable.
Additional circuitry will be added in the future to charge the battery from VCC_FULL(VSOM).

## I/O Expander 0

Expander #0 combines control signals. It is driven by SYS I2C. It is present used with and without SoM / m.2 modules.

:[I/O Expander 0](../pinouts/I2C_EXPANDER_0.md)

This allows control of motion and camera module state


## Edge Sound Expansion connectors

One the edge there are three 20 pin connectors that allow connecting expansion modules
providing Sound/Sensor support.

1.8V signals are needed for suspended state. Should it be 3.3V for audio?


Most LEDs are mounted by embedding them into the board. The PCB being 1mm thick a recess is made to fit the LED of 0.4mm. In the center a 0.4mm hole is drilled to let through light. We must determine the best way to produce accurate holes for a good fit.
It is essential the LEDs are placed accurately to have an equal distance between them.
