# Ziloo

Ziloo is an independent device that sees and senses the environment. It recognises objects and behavior based on what it has been taught. It outputs an event log describing what is perceived.
Ziloo can be placed on a shelf, wall or embedded. I will recognise things and people it has been trained to recognise. They have to appear in front within 20cm - 200cm. Ziloo is primarily used indoors and used at all times of the day.

It receives stereo video input over 2 x 2-lane MIPI CSI2. Additionally it receives sensor input over I2C
for distance, color, brightness. The sensor inputs are processed and disected to identify objects, people and
behaviour. Ziloo can connect over USB to make the output available.
